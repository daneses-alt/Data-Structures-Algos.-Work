# Data-Structures-Algos.-Work
Some projects from my DSA class, taken at my high school. 
Note: the programs require specific files with precise formatting in order to run, as required by our teacher to aid his grading with testcases. I dont have access
to test cases any longer and thus these file formats are lost to time. 

# Huffman Codes
Project using heaps to most efficenitly encode a text input. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding. 

# Risk Game
Project using basic graph theory and Dijkstra's algorithm to find the most efficient path between territories in the board game "Risk."

# Visual Sorts
Project that uses Java graphics to visually display the process of non-comparison sorts. The two sorts displayed in the project are MSD and LSD sort (i.e. radix sort).
